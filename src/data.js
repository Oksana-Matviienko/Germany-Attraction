     description: `Cologne Cathedral has become the most important landmark in Germany not only because of its appearance, but also because of its rich history.
     As early as the first century A.D., a temple dedicated to the Roman gods was erected on the site of the cathedral. From the 4th century onwards, Christian churches began to be built on the site, but they were inevitably destroyed by fires. And in the middle of the 13th century, after the relics of the three Magi were given to the Archbishop of Cologne, it was decided to build a temple. And in 1248, the first stone was laid in the foundation of the Cologne Cathedral. Construction of the cathedral dragged on for centuries - by 1560, only its foundation was laid. Construction was not resumed until 1824, when according to plans found in archives the tall towers and facades were completed. The completion of the construction was celebrated in 1880.
     Today the Cologne Cathedral fascinates not only with its facades but also with its interior. The main hall is decorated with a variety of figures of saints, carved columns, the walls and floor are decorated with mosaics and gilding. Sacred awe is aroused by an oak cross, faithfully reproducing the crucifixion of Christ. In short, every corner here is imbued with its history and one can feel the atmosphere of the Middle Ages, especially during organ music concerts.`,

      description:`The first time one looks at the facade of Neuschwanstein Castle from afar, one associates this amazingly beautiful structure with a toy. The beauty of the neat ivory towers, topped by pointed emerald domes, seems so implausible. Even more fabulous gives an incredibly beautiful natural background in the form of alpine slopes, buried in the green forests. Neuschwanstein castle can safely be included in the rating of the most beautiful places in the world!
      This breathtaking landmark of Germany appeared on the initiative of the Bavarian King Ludwig II, who embodied in the castle his fantastic visions and romantic ideas. The first stone was laid in the foundation of the future castle in 1869. Initially set three years construction term was postponed more than once: labor input of the project, location of the site in the mountains, as well as constant adjustments, which were made in the project by the monarch himself.
      Just like the facade of the castle, the interior furnishings reflected the monarch's fantasy dreams:
      the decoration of the castle halls embodied various plots of Germanic mythology, the walls and ceiling of the rooms are crowned by numerous elements of painting;
      the king's bedroom in neo-Gothic style, with its beautifully carved decorations and high reliefs;
      the prayer room, created in the memory of St. Louis, King of France, hosts a casement altar decorated with a refined carving;
      The image of the swan knight Lohengrin is at the base of the drawing room decorations, and the swan theme can be easily discerned in the carved decoration of the wooden elements and the gold embroidery of the curtains.

      description:`If you are wondering what is the true symbol of Germany and what you should see in Germany first, you should definitely see the Brandenburg Gate. This is a truly legendary structure, impressive in its size, architecture and symbolizing the most important milestones in the country's history.
      Thus, the Peace Gate, as it was originally called, was laid in 1789, and the works of ancient builders were taken as the ideological basis of the project.
      In 1871, the year of the formation of the German Empire around the kingdom of Prussia, the victorious soldiers marched through the Brandenburg Gate;
      in 1918 and 1920, troops of counter-revolutionary soldiers had already passed through the arch;
      in 1945, the red banner of the Russian victors flew on the quadriga of the gate, and Stalin's portrait was hoisted beneath it;
      in 1961, the gate was closed and built into the Berlin Wall, dividing Germany into two states - capitalist and socialist;
      in 1989, when the Berlin Wall collapsed, the gate reopened, since then having become a symbol of peace and national unity.
      The gate is an almost complete replica of the arch of the Propylaeum on the Parthenon. Its total height is 26 meters, the construction has 6 pillars and 5 corridors, the main of which is designed for the passage of solemn corteges.

      description:`n the south of the country, in the Black Forest region, there is a truly fairy-tale landmark in Germany - the Black Forest, which brings back memories of the characters from the famous fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm. Most of the forest is made up of dense and tall spruces, hence the name Black Forest.
      In the shade of the dense forest, streams are ringing, rivers are flowing and whole waterfalls are murmuring. The Danube River, which flows through a number of European countries, has its source in this forest. Deep lakes, huge old spruces, boulders overgrown with moss - everything here seems to keep its special fairy tale secrets.
      For example, the waterfalls of the black forest are considered the highest in the country, and some of them attract streams of tourists.
      Today the black forest is not as dense as it used to be: there are equipped ski resorts, recreation areas and even an amusement park. The water in the lakes of the Black Forest is crystal clear and many divers come here for diving - the deep lakes Schluchsee and Titisee are especially popular. Equally popular are motorboat rides on the mirror-like lake surface.
      Locals as well as visitors often take mountain hikes here - such hikes are well worth the effort. The many well-trodden trails up here allow you to enjoy the local scenery to the full, and at a certain altitude, you'll be able to see an extremely scenic view of the surrounding countryside.`,

      description:`To choose what to see in Germany, you don't have to go far - right in the middle of the European capital, on the small island of Spreeinsel, is one of the most striking and impressive cultural heritage sites in the country - the so-called Museum Island, which is a whole museum complex, including five museums, founded at different times.
      The history of this complex dates back to 1797, when the idea of creating a museum on the island of Spreeinsel was born to exhibit antique collections and art objects from the Middle Ages.
      The Old Museum - The Old Museum was the first to establish a museum complex on the island in 1830. Here the rarest collections of ancient Roman and ancient Greek art have found their place.
      Bode Museum - erected between 1897-1904, the museum includes collections of Byzantine art and numismatic collections of coins from the 7th century B.C. to the present.
      The Pergamon Museum, first opened in 1930, includes the Near Eastern Museum, the Museum of Islamic Art, and the Ancient Collection, with the Pergamon Altar, the Babylonian Gate, and the Mshatta Frieze among its most valuable exhibits.
      The Old National Gallery - opened in 1876, it has an extensive collection of 19th-century paintings and presents works in the styles of Classicism, Impressionism, Romanticism, Modernism, and Biedermeier.
      The new museum was founded in 1855 and is essentially a continuation of the collection of the Old Museum, which was so large that it required the opening of several more exhibition halls.`,

      description:`What associations does the mention of the Reichstag evoke? The bloodiest events, World War II, Adolf Hitler and the red banner flying over this building in 1945 as a sign of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany. However, time moves on, and some associations are gradually replacing others: today the Reichstag is increasingly presented as a symbol of modern and united Germany, a structure with a rich and complicated history.
      This German landmark is located in the heart of the German capital, on Paris Square. In 1884, the first stone was laid in the foundations of the building and construction continued for the next 10 years.
      In 1933, the structure was badly damaged by a fire that occurred there. The former independent communist Marinus van der Lubbe was found guilty at the time, but the Nazis blamed it all on the communists, which prompted a communist coup. The governing body of the Reichstag was dissolved and all meetings from then on were held in the Krol Opera House. For 12 years after that the Reichstag building was not used for its intended purpose, and in 1939 it became a military building.
      In 1945 the building was badly damaged by the Soviet forces and in April of the same year the scarlet victory banner was hoisted over it.
      After a partial reconstruction in 1973, the building was used as a historical museum, and only in 1995 was a complete reconstruction carried out, over which a glass dome and a viewing platform were built.
      Today the Reichstag has become one of the most visited places in Germany - annually more than 13 million tourists from all over the world come here.`,
